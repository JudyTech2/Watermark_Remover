## 📌 What is Watermark Remover?

**Watermark Remover** is a lightweight application that uses image inpainting techniques to intelligently erase watermarks from photos while preserving the surrounding pixels. It's ideal for content creators, designers, and anyone who wants clean, watermark-free visuals.

## 🧠 How It Works

The remover uses a technique called **image inpainting** — a process where missing or unwanted parts of an image are filled in using information from the surrounding areas. We leverage models like **Telea** or **Navier-Stokes** for classic inpainting, and optionally integrate **deep learning models** for more complex tasks.
